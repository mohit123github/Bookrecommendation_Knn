🔍 How It Works


The application uses a collaborative filtering approach with a nearest neighbors algorithm to recommend books based on user input:


Data Preparation: The dataset is cleaned and processed using Pandas, with relevant features extracted for modeling.

Recommendation Logic:

By Title: Normalizes input titles and finds similar titles using a nearest neighbors model.

By Rating: Filters books based on the minimum rating specified by the user.

By Publisher: Retrieves books from a specific publisher and sorts them by average rating.
By Author: Filters books by a specific author and returns recommendations sorted by average rating.

By Author: Filters books by a specific author and returns recommendations sorted by average rating.

User Interface: Built with HTML/CSS for structure and styling, enhanced with JavaScript for dynamic interactions.
